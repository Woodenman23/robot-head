### *Converstational NLP Chatbot with LED matrix visualiser for responses*

This is the next step from LED_controller.

I wanted to build something scalable so everything is being re-written in Go...

Components:
- Go server backend
- OpenAI API integration
- TTS with elevenlabs 
- Google Speech to text
- Local client for pi with built in LED matrix
- Web client for remote access to Chatbot
